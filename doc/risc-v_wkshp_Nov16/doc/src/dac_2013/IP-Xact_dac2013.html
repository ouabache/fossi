&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT SIZE=6>SOCGEN: Design for Reuse Toolset</FONT></H1>
<P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective design for reuse requires that there is a
clear understanding between the component designer and the SOC
architect as to exactly what will be delivered to the System-on-chip
(SOC). This paper introduces the socgen project.It is a design for
reuse toolset that enables the component designer to create and
verify their modules and then deliver them to the architects in a
package that is easily added into any SOC. Socgen is a free
opensource project that is available from the opencores.org site. It
includes several demonstration projects that show how an IP-Xact
enabled toolset&nbsp; can build the multiple views and codesets
needed in todays complex designs. IP-Xact componentGenerators are
used to run both socgen scripts&nbsp; that generate registers and
verilog files as well as external tools such as the fizzim finite
state machine tool.<BR><BR>The project includes a simulation toolflow
that uses icarus verilog for simulation, verilator for linting and
covered for code coverage.&nbsp; It shows how to use IP-Xact to
create testbenches and use them in the myriad of different
combinations needed to verify a component with all its variants. A
synthesys toolflow using Xilinx ISE webpack can compile the designs
and target them for several different fpga demo boards.<BR><BR>Socgen
will create a packaged component complete with documentation and a
unit test suite that can be easily delivered to an chip design team
and inserted using an IP-Xact enabled toolflow. <BR><BR>The example
rtl included with&nbsp; the socgen project consists of other selected
opencores.org projects that were reworked by adding IP-Xact files and
upgrading the code to meet modern design for reuse standards. They
also include low level libraries, testbench bus functional models and
bus definitions that provide the basis for easily sharing ip between
different groups.<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;

<H2 CLASS="western">2.0 Archives 
</H2>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Every organization that designs asics will have an archive. It is
the area where the heads of all the Revision Control System (RCS)
repositories are stored for safekeeping. The first step fo any asic
project is to visit the archives to see there is any IP already
in-house that could be used in the new chip. Then a list of needed IP
is created and a make-buy decision is made. New repositories are
created to receive the purchased IP and to allow the design team to
check in their created works.</P>
<P>There are two ways to manage the IP in the archives, It may be
stored based upon where the IP is used or it may be stored based upon
where the IP was created. In the past IP was stored by usage. The
archives would contain a repository for each asic and that would
contain the chip as well as the entire development environment that
was used to create the netlist.</P>
<P>That approach does not work for todays asics. If a piece of IP is
used in multiple chips then it will appear multiple times in the
archives. Having multiple copies of anything is a serious violation
of design for reuse rules. The biggest problem that todays design
teams are huge and usually have members that do not belong to your
organization. It is important  that these members are only allowed
access to the areas in the archives that they are working on and it
is critical that they are NEVER allowed to access IP from other 
outside vendors.  One easy way to enforce this is to store all IP in
seperate repositories based upon who created it and to allow access
to each designer based upon their organization.</P>
<P>In this scheme the archives will have directories for each
organization with  engineering responsibility that contains all of
their repositories. The host organization will also have its vendor
directory and that will contain a library for each and every ASIC
that it designs.</P>
<P>Each and every piece of IP in the archives should contain a
IP-Xact component file to facilitate managing the IP. Every IP-xact
object has a unique identifier known as the VLNV. This stands for
Vendor,Library,Name and Version.   These four items will give us 24
possible ways to arrange our IP of which 23 are considered WRONG. The
only way to strore an IP-Xact component in the archives is to follow
the order of the VLNV.  On top we have a vendor directory that
matches the vendor name field followed eventually by a matching
library directory and a matching component name directory.  The
component directory must contain all of the different versions but
that may be done either by directories or by filename.
