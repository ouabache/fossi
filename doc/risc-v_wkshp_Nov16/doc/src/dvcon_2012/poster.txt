SOCGEN  A design for reuse development environment


Free opensource libraries and tool set on opencores.org


Ip-Xact compliant IP


   develop component ip and unit test suite 
 

   retargets IP to desired technology



Installation

   subverison download

   install tools

   build workspace

   build_hw

   build_sw

   build fpgas

   run_sims


Prevents  name space collisions from module names and tic variables `

Packages each component into one verilog library file

Eliminates the need for search paths

supports IP-Xact bus definitions  usage

simulation tool flow using icarus verilog

code coverage using covered

rtl checking using verilator

synthesys using Xilinx webpack

simulation debug using gtkwave

finite state machine generation using fizzim

Control and status register rtl code generator












































































  



COMPONENT

   final name selected by soc architect

   no level  for versions  ( no copies "pragmatic programmer")

   ip-xact     designCfg files   yellow_pages  tool_configurations

               not 100% ip-xact
                80/20 rule
                copied data
                missing data
    

   rtl/xml     component files    leaf cells
               design files       hierarchial

               versions over time
               variants over design space

               each version/variant has own files

               avoid variants -use parameters
 
               2 scenerios where you can't use parmeters
                  change port list
                  change file list

               No Supersets

   rtl/verilog   verilog Source
                 verilog include
                 verilog fragment


   rtl/fsm       fsm source files
                 build_fizzim tool

   rtl/regtool   uses ip-xact
                 build_register tool

   views         exactly what each tool needs

                 1 verilog Library file

                 no # statements

                 no search paths

                 base name on all modules

                 build_verilogLib too


                build_verilog tool
                converts data sheet into real part









































































                 

SIMULATION


     /sim/xml      contains testbenches
                   one per variant
                   all code in shared Testbench bfm's


    /icarus/test_name  directory
                      test_define
                      vcd dump
                      wave.sav

                   

SYNTHESYS
