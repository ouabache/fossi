Abstract</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effective design
for reuse requires that there is a clear understanding between the
component designer and the SOC architect as to exactly what will be
delivered to the System-on-chip (SOC). This paper introduces the socgen
project.It is a
design for reuse toolset that enables the component designer to create
and verify their modules and then deliver them to the architects in a
package that is easily added into any SOC. Socgen is a free opensource
project that is available from the opencores.org site. It includes
several
demonstration projects that show how an IP-Xact enabled toolset&nbsp;
can build
the multiple views and codesets needed in todays complex designs.
IP-Xact
componentGenerators are used to run both socgen scripts&nbsp; that
generate registers and verilog files as well as
external tools such as the fizzim finite state machine tool.<br>
<br>
The project includes a simulation toolflow that uses icarus verilog for
simulation, verilator for linting and covered for code coverage.&nbsp;
It shows how to use IP-Xact to create testbenches and use them in the
myriad of different combinations needed to verify a component with all
its variants. A synthesys toolflow using Xilinx ISE webpack can compile
the designs and target them for several different fpga demo boards.<br>
<br>
Socgen will create a packaged component complete with documentation and
a unit test suite that can be easily delivered to an chip design team
and inserted using an IP-Xact enabled toolflow. <br>
<br>
The example rtl included with&nbsp; the socgen project consists of
other selected opencores.org projects that were reworked by adding
IP-Xact files and upgrading the code to meet modern design for reuse
standards. They also include low level libraries, testbench bus
functional models and bus definitions that provide the basis for easily
sharing ip between different groups.<br>

1.0&nbsp; Introduction<br>
</h2>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time Sytem designers designed printed circuit boards.
These boards were stuffed with hundreds of different components that
you purchased through distributers and each one came with a datasheet
that the system designer would use to understand the part and how to
config and interconnect it into their design.&nbsp; All datasheets
followed the same format. The front page contained the name and part
numbers of the component and its variants. You had a graphic showing
all the exterior connections along with an explanation of what the
signals did. There were sections for the absolute maximun ratings and
timing requirements that all uses the same nomenclature. <br>
</p>
<p>Somehow in our conversion from&nbsp; PCB system design into a
internal IC system design we forgot about datsheets. Todays datasheet
for an IP component is a free form document in which&nbsp; the
component designer details everything that they think that the
architects will need to know.&nbsp; There is no industry wide standard
detailing&nbsp; exactly what goes into a IP datasheet and how to
present it.&nbsp; Todays system designers are faced with hundreds of
components each documented in their own unique way. Are we surprised
that trying to use other designers components is a slow process?<br>
</p>
<p>Futhermore todays component designers have missed one of the biggest
changes that has swept this industry in the last 30 years. Todays
component designer does not&nbsp; create a datasheet for the system
designers to read. Today the component designers tool flow creates the
datasheet for the system designers tool flow to parse. IP-Xact
defines&nbsp; a xml schema that details exactly what the component
designer<br>
must deliver with their IP so that the system designers can easily
configure and interconnect it in their chip.<br>
</p>
<p>Socgen is demonstration project that provides an IP-Xact enabled
tool chain capable of doing full asic/fpga designs<br>
