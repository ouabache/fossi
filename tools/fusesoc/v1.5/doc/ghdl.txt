GHDL
====

GHDL is an open source VHDL simulator, which fully supports IEEE 1076-1987, IEEE 1076-1993, IEE 1076-2002 and partially the 1076-2008 version of VHDL

The following file types are recognized by the GHDL backend

- vhdlSource
- vhdlSource-87
- vhdlSource-93
- vhdlSource-2008

Configure
---------

Build
-----

During the build phase, FuseSoC runs the GHDL analyze command (`ghdl -a`) on each VHDL file in the design. Extra options for the analyze step can be specified with `analyze_options` in the `[ghdl]` section. After all source files have been analyzed, the top level, which is specified with `toplevel` in the `[simulator]` section, is elaborated (`ghdl -e`)

Run
---
During the run phase, `ghdl -r` is called with the following arguments

- Any options specified in the `run_options` parameter in the `[ghdl]` section
- The simulator toplevel(s) which is read from the `toplevel` parameter in the `[simulator]` section

Rebuilding from the exported sources is not yet supported
