ModelSim
========

The ModelSim backend is used to simulate designs using Mentor Graphics ModelSim simulator. ModelSim is a proprietary simulator that supports Verilog, VHDL and SystemC.

In order to use the ModelSim backend, the environment variable `$MODEL_TECH` must be set to `<modelsim install path>/bin`

The following file types are recognized by the ModelSim backend

- verilogSource
- verilogSource-95
- verilogSource-2001
- verilogSource-2005
- systemVerilogSource
- systemVerilogSource-3.0
- systemVerilogSource-3.1
- systemVerilogSource-3.1a
- vhdlSource
- vhdlSource-87
- vhdlSource-93
- vhdlSource-2008
- tclSource
- user

Configure
---------
During the configure phase, build commands for all VHDL, Verilog and SystemVerilog files are written to a TCL file called `fusesoc_build_rtl.tcl`. The `vlog` command is used to build (system)verilog files, and additional options for this command can be specified with the `vlog_options` parameter in the `[modelsim]` section. If the design also contains any VPI libraries, an additional Makefile is created with instructions for how to rebuild them.

A top-level TCL script called `fusesoc_main.tcl` is created to execute `fusesoc_build_rtl.tcl`, the VPI Makefile and also any additional files with the file type tclSource found in the design

Build
-----
During the build phase, the `fusesoc_main.tcl` script is executed.

Run
---
During the run phase, `vsim` is called with the following arguments

- The default options `-quiet -c -do "run -all"` These can be overridden by setting the `run_default_args` options in the `[modelsim]` section to something else
- Any options specified in the `vsim_options` parameter in the `[modelsim]` section
- All VPI libraries to be loaded
- The simulator toplevel(s) which is read from the `toplevel` parameter in the `[simulator]` section
- Any plusargs, top-level verilog parameters or VHDL generics specified on the command line

To rebuild the complete simulation model from within a running ModelSim instance, execute `fusesoc_main.tcl`, or `fusesoc_build_rtl.tcl` to just rebuild the RTL files. Note that these commands only operate on the exported design.
