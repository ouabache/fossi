Usage:  covered rank (-h | ([<options>] <database_to_rank> <database_to_rank>+)

   -h                           Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -depth <number>           Specifies the minimum number of CDD files to hit each coverage point.
                                  The value of <number> should be a value of 1 or more.  Default is 1.
      -names-only               If specified, outputs only the needed CDD filenames that need to be
                                  run in the order they need to be run.  If this option is not set, a
                                  report-style output is provided with additional information.
      -f <filename>             Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.
      -required-list <filename> Name of file containing list of CDD files which are required to be in the
                                  list of ranked CDDs to be run.
      -required-cdd <filename>  Name of CDD file that is required to be in the list of ranked CDDs to be run.
      -d <directory>            Directory to search for CDD files to include.  This option is used in
                                  conjunction with the -ext option which specifies the file extension
                                  to use for determining which files in the directory are CDD files.
      -ext <extension>          Used in conjunction with the -d option.  If no -ext options are specified
                                  on the command-line, the default value of '.cdd' is used.  Note that
                                  a period (.) should be specified.
      -o <filename>             Name of file to output ranking information to.  Default is stdout.
      -weight-line <number>     Specifies a relative weighting for line coverage used to rank
                                  non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes line coverage
                                  from ranking consideration.  Default value is 1.
      -weight-toggle <number>   Specifies a relative weighting for toggle coverage used to rank
                                  non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes toggle coverage
                                  from ranking consideration.  Default value is 1.
      -weight-memory <number>   Specifies a relative weighting for memory coverage used to rank
                                  non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes memory coverage
                                  from ranking consideration.  Default value is 1.
      -weight-comb <number>     Specifies a relative weighting for combinational logic coverage used
                                  to rank non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes combinational
                                  logic coverage from ranking consideration.  Default value is 1.
      -weight-fsm <number>      Specifies a relative weighting for FSM state/state transition coverage
                                  used to rank non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes FSM
                                  coverage from ranking consideration.  Default value is 1.
      -weight-assert <number>   Specifies a relative weighting for assertion coverage used to rank
                                  non-unique coverage points.  A value of 0 removes assertion coverage
                                  from ranking consideration.  Default value is 0.
      -v                        Outputs verbose information during the rank selection process.  This output
                                  is not for debugging purposes, but rather gives the user insight into
                                  what's going on "behind the scenes" during the ranking process.
