Usage:  covered merge (-h | [<options>] <existing_database> <database_to_merge>+)

   -h                         Displays this help information.

   Options:
      -o <filename>           File to output new database to.  If this argument is not
                                specified, the <existing_database> is used as the output
                                database name.
      -f <filename>           Name of file containing additional arguments to parse.
      -d <directory>          Directory to search for CDD files to include.  This option is used in
                                conjunction with the -ext option which specifies the file extension
                                to use for determining which files in the directory are CDD files.
      -er <value>             Specifies how to handle exclusion reason resolution.  If two or more CDD files being
                                merged have exclusion reasons specified for the same coverage point, the exclusion
                                reason needs to be resolved (unless it is the same string value).  If this option
                                is not specified and a conflict is found, Covered will interactively request input
                                for each exclusion as to how to handle it.  If this option is specified, it tells
                                Covered how to handle all exclusion reason conflicts.  The values are as follows:
                                  first - CDD file that contained the first exclusion reason is used.
                                  last  - CDD file that contained the last exclusion reason is used.
                                  all   - All exclusion reasons are used (concatenated).
                                  new   - Use the newest exclusion reason specified.
                                  old   - Use the oldest exclusion reason specified.
      -ext <extension>        Used in conjunction with the -d option.  If no -ext options are specified
                                on the command-line, the default value of '.cdd' is used.  Note that
                                a period (.) should be specified.
      -m <message>            Allows the user to specify information about this CDD file.  This information
                                can be anything (messages with whitespace should be surrounded by double-quotation
                                marks), but may include something about the simulation arguments to more easily
                                link the CDD file to its simulation for purposes of recreating the CDD file.
