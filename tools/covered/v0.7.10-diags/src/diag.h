 Revision 1.3  2007/11/20 05:28:56  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.2  2006/03/03 23:24:53  phase1geo
 Fixing C-based run script.  This is now working for all but one diagnostic to this
 point.  There is still some work to do here, however.

 Revision 1.1  2006/02/27 23:22:10  phase1geo
 Working on C-version of run command.  Initial version only -- does not work
 at this point.
