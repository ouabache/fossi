What is this directory used for?
--------------------------------

This directory contains diagnostics for verifying the correctness of the
Covered utility.  The "c" directory contains a suite of diagnostics that compile
in portions of the Covered functions for verifying the correctness of individual
functions.  The "verilog" directory contains a suite of diagnostics that run
portions of Verilog code to verify that the Covered utility generates the correct
coverage numbers for the specified design.


What do I do now that I have untar'ed this package?
---------------------------------------------------

Simply move the main "diags" directory into the main covered directory that is associated
with this release.


How do I run a regression?
--------------------------

To run a full regression for both diagnostic suites, simply type:

    make regress

The regression suite logfile will be called "regress.log" in this directory.

Note:

To run the Verilog testsuite, Icarus Verilog must be installed on your machine.
To obtain the Icarus Verilog executable, go to:
