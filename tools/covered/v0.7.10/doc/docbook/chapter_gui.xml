    The Covered report viewer GUI allows a user to view the coverage results from one or more CDD (Covered Design Database) files that have 
    been previously generated using the Covered score and/or merge commands.  The advantages of using the GUI versus using an ASCII file to 
    view coverage results are the following:

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          View code that is covered/uncovered within the actual source file text (more context)
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Quickly see which modules/instances were uncovered for each coverage metric.

        <para>
          Ability to hide/unhide verbose information for uncovered code.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Quickly find expressions that caused combinational logic cases to be uncovered.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Allows user to focus on a particular expression/signal/module/instance that is uncovered.
        </para>

        <para>
          Non-useful coverage cases can be interactively excluded/included and summary information automatically recalculated.

    Because the nature of a GUI interface is much more interactive than a generated text file report, the Covered report viewer is meant 
    to provide the user a more in-depth look at the logic to identify the reasons for not achieving full coverage.  This is the ultimate 
    goal of the GUI interface -- to be an interactive tool for identifying and understanding why full code coverage was not achieved and 
    how to write tests that will cover those areas.

  <para>
    The GUI report viewer is invoked by specifying the '-view' option to the Covered report command.  The report viewer is part of the 
    report command and is, therefore, not used to parse/score a design.  However, merging maytake place with the GUI as multiple CDD 
    files may be read, merged (assumingall of the CDD files came from the same DUT) and saved in CDD file format.

    The rest of the user manual pages describe the various widgets and windows of the GUI and their functionality.  Additionally, this 
    user manual contains information on how to get the most out of the Covered GUI report viewer.
