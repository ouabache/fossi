    This chapter describes the meanings of the textual report output that Covered generates when the report command is 
    issued. It is well understood by the developers of Covered that a code coverage tool is only as good as the output 
    that it generates, and this, of course, includes the ability to discern the information provided by the report.
  </p><p>
    To help describe the various sections of a Covered report, we will use a relatively small Verilog file containing 
    our DUT, generating the two main types of reports (module and instance) based on the CDD generated for this file. 
    This example file is provided <a href="example.v.html" target="_top">here</a>
  </p><p>
    After being compiled and run, this module is scored with the following Covered command:
  </p><p>
    <code class="code">covered score -t main -v example.v -o example.cdd -vcd example.vcd</code>
  </p><p>
    The module-based verbose report can be viewed in its entirety <a href="example.rptM.html" target="_top">example.rptM.html</a> and is 
    generated with the following command:
  </p><p>
    <code class="code">covered report -d v example.cdd</code>
  </p><p>
    The instance-based verbose report can be viewed in its entirety <a href="example.rptI.html" target="_top">here</a> and is 
    generated with the following command:
  </p><p>
    <code class="code">covered report -i -d v example.cdd</code>
  </p><p>
    The instructions for analyzing each of the six types of coverage information from the report can be found on the 
    following pages.

        For module-based reports, the summary table for line metrics includes information for the name of each module 
        that was covered and the name of the file in which the module is described in.  Lines 
        <a href="example.rptM.html#15" target="_top">15 through 24</a> of the module-based report show what this information 
        looks like in the report. We have three modules that were scored within our DUT: main, fsma and fsmb.  The 
        table shows that all three modules were described in the file "example.v".
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.reading.line.summary.inst"></a>Summary Information Description - Instance-based</h3></div></div></div><p>
        For instance-based reports, the summary table for line metrics includes information for the Verilog hierarchy 
        pertaining to each instance on the left-hand-side of each row.  Lines <a href="example.rptI.html#15" target="_top">example.rptI.html#15</a> 
        of the instance-based report show what this information looks like in the report.  In our DUT example, there 
        are three instances within the design with the Verilog hierarchies of "main", "main.fsm1" and "main.fsm2".
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.reading.line.summary.both"></a>Summary Information Description - Both</h3></div></div></div><p>
        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the line coverage, 
        followed by a calculated percent of the lines that were hit (calculated by taking the number of lines hit 
        during simulation divided by the total number of lines that Covered simulated).  The hit value indicates how 
        many lines were executed during the simulation; the miss value indicates the number of lines not executed 
        during simulation; and the total value indicates the total number of lines within the specified 
        module/instance that Covered was able to simulate.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage value in the far left of the summary table is 100%, this indicates that all lines that 
        Covered was capable of simulating (for the module/instance of this row) were executed. If the value of the 
        percentage is less than 100%, this indicates that some number of lines were not executed and full coverage 
        was not achieved for that module/instance. Note that for a module/instance which does not contain any lines 
        in which Covered was able to simulate, the values of hit, miss, and total will be 0 while the hit percentage 
        value will indicate 100%.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.reading.line.verbose.both"></a>Verbose Information Description - Both</h3></div></div></div><p>
        If the miss value for a particular module was not 0 (indicating that lines were missed during simulation) and 
        the '-d v' option was specified on the command-line (specifying to output verbose reporting information), the 
        line that was missed during simulation will be output below the summary information per module that contained 
        missed lines. In our sample report, there was one line that was missed during simulation (according to the 
        summary output) for the module called "fsmb" (instance "main.fsmb"). The line number and Verilog line that was 
        missed is output in lines <a href="example.rptM.html#25" target="_top">25 through 29</a> of the module-based report and 
        in lines <a href="example.rptI.html#25" target="_top">25 through 29</a> of the instance-based report.
      </p><p>
        If a module does not contain any missed lines and the '-d v' option was specified, no verbose output will be 
        displayed for this module. Likewise, if a module/instance does not contain any lines that Covered could 
        execute, no verbose output will be displayed.
      </p></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="img/note.gif"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
        The definition of what Covered considers a line is a statement (ex. assignment, conditional, etc.).  If a 
        statement is written in such a way that it consumes multiple file lines, Covered only counts the statement 
        as one line. The user can assume that if the beginning of a statement is labeled as missed, the entire 
        expression was missed (not just the first line of the expression). For example, consider the following code:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  always @(posedge b)
    a &lt;= (b &amp; c) |
         (d &amp; e);      
        
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        If the expression
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  a &lt;= (b &amp; c) | (d &amp; e);      
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        is not executed during simulation, Covered will indicate that only one line was missed during execution (not 
        two), and it will display the missing line (if verbose reporting is specified with the '-d v' option) as the 
        following:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  2:      assign a &lt;= (b &amp; c) ...      
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        The "..." notation at the end of the Verilog output indicates that the statement was a multiline statement 
        in the source code but is only considered one line.

        For instance-based reports, the summary table for toggle metrics includes information for the Verilog 
        hierarchy pertaining to each instance on the left-hand-side of each row.  Lines 
        <a href="example.rptI.html#41" target="_top">41 through 51</a> of the instance-based report show what this 
        information looks like in the report. In our DUT example, there are three instances within the design with

        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the toggle 0-&gt;1 
        coverage, followed by a calculated percent of the signal bits that toggled from a value of 0 to a value of 
        1 (calculated by taking the number of bits that toggled from 0 to 1 during simulation divided by the total 
        number of signal bits). The hit value indicates how many signal bits were toggle from a value of 0 to 1 during 
        simulation; the miss value indicates the number of signal bits that were not toggled from a value of 0 to 1 
        during simulation; and the total value indicates the total number of signal bits within the specified 
        module/instance that Covered was able to simulate.
      </p><p>
        To the right of this information is the hit, miss and total statistics for signal bits that toggled from a 
        value of 1 to a value of 0.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage values in the right of the summary table are 100%, this indicates that all signal bits 
        toggled from a value of 0 to 1 and back to 0 during simulating (for the module/instance of this row).  If the 
        values of the percentage are less than 100%, this indicates that some signal bits did not fully toggle 
        during simulation and full toggle coverage was not achieved for that module/instance.  Note that for a 
        module/instance which does not contain any signals in which Covered was able to simulate, the values of hit, 
        miss, and total will be 0 while the hit percentage value will indicate 100%.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.reading.toggle.verbose.both"></a>Verbose Information Description - Both</h3></div></div></div><p>
        If the miss value for a particular module/instance was not 0 (indicating that one or more signal bits did not 
        fully toggle during simulation) and the '-d v' option was specified on the command-line (specifying to output 
        verbose reporting information), the signals that were missed during simulation will be output below the 
        summary information per module/instance that contained missed signal bit toggles. In our sample module-based 
        report, there were three signals in module "main" ("go", "state", and "error"), three signals in module 
        "fsma" ("go", "state" and "next_state"), and three signals in module "fsmb" ("go", "next_state" and 
        "state") that were not fully toggled (see lines <a href="example.rptM.html#53" target="_top">53 through 90</a>).
      </p><p>
        For each signal in the verbose toggle table, the format is the following:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
        &lt;signal_name&gt;          0-&gt;1: &lt;hexidecimal_value&gt;
        .......................1-&gt;0: &lt;hexidecimal_value&gt;
        
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        The name of the signal is specified in the upper left corner. The bitwise toggle information for the signal 
        from a value of 0 to a value of 1 is specified in the upper right corner.  The hexidecimal value represents 
        bits in the signal, each bit corresponding to the matching bit of the signal. If a bit value is set to the 
        value 1, this indicates that this bit in the signal toggled from a value of 0 to a value of 1.  If a bit 
        value is set to the value 0, this indicates that this bit in the signal did NOT toggle from a value of 0 
        to a value of 1; therefore, full toggle coverage was not achieved for this signal.  For example, for the 
        signal called "go" in the module/instance "main", the verbose toggle information looks like:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  go         0-&gt;1: 1'b1
  ...........1-&gt;0: 1'b0      
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        This is indicating that bit 0 of the signal called "go" successfully toggled from a value of 0 to 1 during 
        simulation (because the bit value at bit location 0 is a value of 1).  However, the signal did not toggle 
        from a value of 1 to a value of 0 during simulation, thus the signal was not considered fully toggled.
      </p><p>
        It is important to note that the hexidecimal values are displayed with the least-significant bit of the 
        signal being output on the far right of the value while the most-significant bit of the signal is output 
        on the far left of the value.

        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the various memory 
        coverage metrics, followed by a calculated percent of each memory coverage metric that was hit (calculated 
        by taking the number hit during simulation divided by the total number that Covered could have simulated). 
        The hit value indicates how many were executed during the simulation; the miss value indicates the number 
        not executed during simulation; and the total value indicates the total number within the specified 
        module/instance that Covered can simulate. All four metrics (AME toggle 0-&gt;1, AME toggle 1-&gt;0, AME write 
        and AME read) are listed in the summary section.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage value in the far left of the summary table is 100%, this indicates that all coverage 
        points that Covered was capable of simulating (for the module/instance of this row) were executed.  If the 
        value of the percentage is less than 100%, this indicates that some number of coverage points were not 
        executed and full coverage was not achieved for that module/instance. Note that for a module/instance which 
        does not contain any coverage points in which Covered was able to simulate, the values of hit, miss, and

        toggle coverage verbose information, the individual bits are grouped together and displayed in hexidecimal 
        form to conserve space and make the task of figuring out exactly which bit positions did not toggle easier. 
        See lines <a href="example.rptM.html#117" target="_top">117 through 151</a> for an example of this output.

        If the -c option is used, Covered outputs the names of the memories that were fully covered during simulation only.

        For instance-based reports, the summary table for combinational logic metrics includes information for the 
        Verilog hierarchy pertaining to each instance on the left-hand-side of each row.  Lines 
        <a href="example.rptI.html#154" target="_top">154 through 164</a> of the instance-based report show what this 
        information looks like in the report.  In our DUT example, there are three instances within the design with 
        the Verilog hierarchies of "main", "main.fsm1", and "main.fsm2".
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.reading.logic.summary.both"></a>Summary Information Description - Both</h3></div></div></div><p>
        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the combinational 
        logic coverage, followed by a calculated percent of the combinational logic expression values that were 
        hit (calculated by taking the number of combinational logic expression values hit during simulation divided 
        by the total number of expression values that Covered could have simulated). The hit value indicates how 
        many expression values were achieved during the simulation; the miss value indicates the number of expression 
        values not achieved during simulation; and the total value indicates the total number of combinational logic 
        expression values that could have been achieved in the specified module/instance.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage value in the far left of the summary table is 100%, this indicates that all combinational 
        logic expression values that Covered was capable of achieving (for the module/instance of this row) were hit. 
        If the value of the percentage is less than 100%, this indicates that some number of expression values 
        were not achieved and full coverage was not achieved for that module/instance. Note that for a module/instance 
        which does not contain any combinational logic expressions in which Covered was able to simulate, the values of 
        hit, miss, and total will be 0 while the hit percentage value will indicate 100%.

        The verbose output for combinational coverage is a bit more sophisticated than the line or toggle.  Basically, 
        for each expression that was found to not be fully covered (either the expression itself or some sub-expression 
        in the tree was not fully covered), the expression is output with various sub-expressions underlined 
        and identified with a number.  Each expression is also supplied with the line number that the expression 
        started at in its module file. In our example, there is an uncovered expression in the module called "main" 
        (see lines <a href="example.rptM.html#170" target="_top">170 through 205</a> (numbered 5) which contains four 
        uncovered subexpressions (numbered 1 through 4).
      </p><p>
        Below each expression, there will be one or more tables which specify a particular sub-expression that was not 
        fully covered along with information describing what cases were not covered for that sub-expression.
      </p><p>
        In the report output above, we see that there was one expression in module "main" that did not achieve 100% 
        coverage that starts on line 14 of the Verilog source.  The expression is output to the report with certain 
        sub-expressions underlined and labeled with an integer value for reference.
      </p><p>
        For this one expression, there were found to be four subexpressions (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4) that were found to not 
        be 100% covered. Taking a look at subexpression 1 report output, the numbers to the right of the string 
        "Expression 1" tell us the number of logical combinations of this subexpression that were hit (in this case 
        2 combinations were hit) and the total number of logical combinations that this subexpression can have (in this 
        case 3 combinations were achievable).  The character string below this information tells us the type of 
        subexpression that we are examining. For subexpression 1, the type is the bitwise AND operator.
      </p><p>
        The table below this information for subexpression 1, lists the potential combinations that this subexpression 
        could have reached with a '*' character placed underneath the combination(s) that were missed.  In the case of 
        subexpression 1, the left and right subexpressions did not evaluate to values of 1 simultaneously.  The letter 
        'L' above each possible combination indicates the value that the left subexpression achieved at the same time 
        as the value under the right subexpression indicated with the letter 'R'. Legal values for a subexpression are 
        '0', '1' or '-' (which indicates that this subexpression value could either be 0 or 1).

        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the FSM state 
        coverage, followed by a calculated percent of the FSM states that were hit (calculated by taking the number 
        of FSM states hit during simulation divided by the total number of FSM states that Covered could have 
        simulated).  The hit value indicates how many FSM states were executed during the simulation; the miss value 
        indicates the number of FSM states not executed during simulation; and the total value indicates the total 
        number of FSM states within the specified module/instance that Covered can simulate.
      </p><p>
        To the right of the FSM state summary information is the FSM state-transition hit, miss, total and percentage 
        hit summary information for each module/instance.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage value in the far left of the summary table is 100%, this indicates that all FSM states and 
        state-transitions that Covered was capable of simulating (for the module/instance of this row) were executed. 
        If the value of the percentage is less than 100%, this indicates that some number of FSM states and/or FSM 
        state-transitions were not executed and full coverage was not achieved for that module/instance.  Note that 
        for a module/instance which does not contain any FSMs in which Covered was able to simulate, the values of 
        hit, miss, and total will be 0 while the hit percentage value will indicate 100%.

        The verbose output for FSM coverage is split into the state coverage information and the state transition 
        coverage information.  When an FSM is found to be not fully covered (i.e., the number of hit states/state 
        transitions is not equal to the number of attainable states/state transitions), the missed states are output 
        to the report as a list of state values in hexidecimal format as follows:
      </p><p>
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  &lt;hexidecimal value&gt;
        </pre><p>
      </p><p>
        When an FSM is found to be not fully covered, the missed state transitions are output to the report as a list 
        of state transitions in the format below:

        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  &lt;hexidecimal input state value&gt; -&gt; &lt;hexidecimal output state value&gt;

      </p><p>
        If the -c option is used or the number of attainable state/state transitions are unknown for the specified 
        FSM, Covered outputs this information in the same way as the missed cases except that the title of the 
        output is "Hit cases". If the number of attainable states/state transitions is unknown, providing the cases 
        that were hit during simulation is useful in aiding the user in determining coverage.  In this case, the 
        summary report will output question marks in the missed and total categories, showing the user that this 
        information was not known by Covered.

        On the right-hand side of each row in the table are the hit, miss and total numbers for the assertion 
        coverage points (ACP), followed by a calculated percent of the ACPs that were hit (calculated by taking 
        the number of ACPs hit during simulation divided by the total number of ACPs that Covered could have 
        simulated).  The hit value indicates how many ACPs were executed during the simulation; the miss value 
        indicates the number of ACPs not executed during simulation; and the total value indicates the total 
        number of ACPs within the specified module/instance that Covered can simulate. Note that more than one 
        coverage point may exist within a single assertion coverage module.
      </p><p>
        If the percentage value in the far left of the summary table is 100%, this indicates that all ACPs that
