      The score command is initiated with the following call:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">
        covered [<span class="emphasis"><em>global_options</em></span>] score -t <span class="emphasis"><em>top_module</em></span> [<span class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span>]
      </code>
    </p><p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>top_module</em></span> parameter is required for the scoring purposes and represents the top-most module that
      will be covered. It is important to note that Covered does not need to parse the entire DUT. It only parses that part of
      the design which will receive coverage results. More on this will be described <a href="chapter.score.html#section.score.t" title="9.3. Specifying What to Cover">Section 9.3, &#8220;Specifying What to Cover&#8221;</a> below.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.options"></a>9.2. Options</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The following table describes the additional options that can be passed to the score command. Note that it is optional in
      how you tell Covered where to find the Verilog design files; however, it is not optional to exclude the Verilog files. If
      no Verilog can be found that contains at least the top instance, Covered will generate an error message to the user
      specifying that it was unable to find the required Verilog modules.

      Covered is not a logic simulator and, therefore, is not required to parse the entire DUT. True simulation is performed by the Verilog simulator used
      to generate the VCD/LXT2/FST dumpfile. Covered, therefore, is given the ability to parse only the part of the DUT that is to be scored for coverage.
      Having this ability to ignore parts of the DUT has several advantages in the way of performance. Less memory is necessary for coverage simulation/
      calculation. Additionally, less processing is also required which leads to faster turnaround. On the other hand, since Covered ignores the parts of
      the design not being scored, some information is not automatically extracted by Covered that is required for scoring the specified part of the DUT.
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>defparam</em></span> statement is one such statement. More on this is mentioned in the following section.
    </p><p>
      The following example describes a complete DUT and how to cause Covered to score various parts of the DUT.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="figure"><a name="figure.score.t"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.1. Hierarchical Tree View of Example DUT</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="img/vhier.png" alt="Hierarchical Tree View of Example DUT"></div></div></div><p><br class="figure-break">
    </p><p>
      Assume that the following Verilog modules are used to create this tree.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>module "test" instantiated as "test" in the above figure</p></li><li><p>module "foomod" instantiated as "foo"</p></li><li><p>module "barmod" instantiated as "bar"</p></li><li><p>module "amod" instantiated as "a"</p></li><li><p>module "bmod" instantiated as "b"</p></li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>
      To get coverage for the entire design, the covered command line would be:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">covered score -t test -i test (rest of command-line)</code>
    </p><p>
      Because both the -t and -i options are the same value (the module name is the same as the instance name), only the -t option needs to be specified.
      If the -i option is not specified, Covered will assume that the instance name of the top module is the same name as the top module itself. Note that
      the -t option always needs to be specified for the score command.
    </p><p>
      To get coverage for the instance foo and all modules below it, the covered command line would be:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">covered score -t foomod -i test.foo (rest of command-line)</code>
    </p><p>
      In this case, we do not wish to score the module test (the top-level file for the design) but rather wish to gain coverage information for module
      foomod and all instantiated modules underneath it. Since foomod is not the top-level design file, the -i option must be specified to tell Covered
      what the hierarchical scope of the top-level score file is in relation to the entire design. The main reason why this is necessary is so that
      Covered will be able to locate the dumpfile information for the modules/instances that need to be scored.
    </p><p>
      To get coverage for only the instance foo (and none of the modules instantiated below it in the hierarchy), Covered command-line would look like the
      following:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">covered score -t foomod -i test.foo -e amod -e bmod</code>
    </p><p>
      Here we see the use of the -e option, it takes a module name as its value. When a module with the matching name is found in the hierarchy, it and
      all of its submodules are removed from coverage. You may specify as many -e arguments as necessary to select the appropriate modules to cover.
    </p><p>
      To get coverage for the instance foo and all modules below it, in addition to the instance bar, you would have to run Covered twice (once for each
      top instance).
    </p><p>
      The -vcd <span class="emphasis"><em>vcd_dumpfile</em></span>, -lxt <span class="emphasis"><em>lxt_dumpfile</em></span> or -fst <span class="emphasis"><em>fst_dumpfile</em></span> parameter is simply
      the name of the VCD/LXT2/FST dumpfile that contains all of the module instances selected by the -t parameter (in combination with the -e option
      -- see below).
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.e"></a>9.4. Specifying What Not to Cover (Coverage Exclusions)</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Besides the -e option (scope exclusion), Covered comes equipped with several other means of excluding codes from coverage consideration. The -ea, -
      ec, -ei and -ef exclusion options cause Covered to not simulate always blocks, continuous assignment blocks, initial blocks and final blocks,
      respectively, allowing for additional score command performance enhancement opportunities. These options affect all code that is under coverage
      consideration for the current score command, and cannot be turned on/off on an individual basis.
    </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section.score.ep"></a>Using the -ep Option for Exclusion</h3></div></div></div><p>
        The -ep exclusion option allows Covered to exclude all code that has user-specified coverage pragmas embedded inline in the code being considered
        for coverage. By default, these pragmas look like the following:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="example"><a name="example.score.ep"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 9.1. Inline Pragmas to Turn Coverage Exclusion On/Off</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
  module foo;

    // coverage off
    ...
    // coverage on

  endmodule;
          </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
      </p><p>
        Any registers, nets, variables, blocks, expressions, FSMs or assertions found within these pragmas within the design being parsed by Covered will
        be excluded from coverage consideration when the -ep option is specified. If the -ep option is not specified, these pragmas are ignored by
        Covered.
      </p><p>
        The code that is found between these pragmas is not removed from resimulation, however. Therefore, if the user decides that any code found within
        these pragmas needs to be considered, they may change the exclusion properties via the GUI without needing to rerun Covered's score command.
        Coverage numbers in generated reports will treat excluded code as though it has been hit (i.e., the coverage points will be a part of the total
        number and the hit counts will be increased as though these coverage points were hit during simulation).
      </p><p>
        The coverage pragmas may use either the single-line C++ comment style (//) or the multi-line C comment style (/* */). By default, the pragma is
        identified with the keyword 'coverage' following the comment characters. This value can be changed by the user, if needed, by specifying a string
        value to the right of the -ep option in the score command. This can be useful if there are other programs that use the same pragma keyword and
        causes conflicts with Covered's use of this pragma name. The value specified after the keyword is either 'off' (meaning that code should be
        excluded from coverage consideration after this comment) or 'on' (meaning that code should be considered for coverage after this comment). The
        values of '<code class="code">off</code>' and '<code class="code">on</code>' have the same meanings regardless of the pragma keyword so be sure to rename the pragma keyword
        to something that is appropriate.
      </p><p>
        Coverage pragmas may be embedded within each other, if desired. That is the following code example is allowed and handled properly by Covered'
        parser:
      </p><p>
        </p><div class="example"><a name="example.score.ep2"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 9.2. Example of Embedded Coverage On/Off Pragmas</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
  module foobar;

    reg b, c, d, e;

    // coverage off

    wire a;

    // coverage off
    assign a = b &amp; c;
    // coverage on

    assign e = ~d;
    // coverage on

  endmodule
          </pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break">
      </p><p>
        The net effect of this example is that all code between the outer '<code class="code">coverage off</code>' and '<code class="code">coverage on</code>' pragmas are
        excluded from coverage.
      </p><p>
        One last note about the -ep option is that coverage exclusion is restricted on a per file basis. That is, if the user specifies a
        '<code class="code">// coverage off</code>' pragma within a file and does not specify a '<code class="code">// coverage on</code>' pragma later in the file, the next file
        to be parsed by Covered will be handled as if coverage is on. Coverage pragmas can, however, span across multiple modules or other entities within
        the same file.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.param"></a>9.5. Overriding Parameters (-P option)</h2></div></div></div><p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>defparam</em></span> statement can override any parameter specified in the DUT from any module in the DUT. Since parameter information
      is not typically specified in VCD/LXT2/FST dumpfiles, Covered needs to know about all parameter values at score time. Since all defparam statements are
      ignored by the Covered parser (even those in the DUT being scored), the user must inform Covered of any parameters that need to be overridden. This
      is accomplished with the -P option to the score command.
    </p><p>
      The first value in the -P option is the hierarchical reference to the parameter that needs to be overridden. The second value (following the '='
      sign) specifies the value to assign the parameter to. This will override any default value assigned to that parameter. The user may not override the
      same parameter value twice on the command-line. Additionally, if the parameter is already being overridden in the design via an inline parameter
      override (parameter overrides specified in the '#(...)' part of the module instantiation).
    </p><p>
      As an example of how to override a parameter value on the score command-line, let's assume that there is a parameter called 'google' in the module
      called 'amod' used in the example in Section 9.3. The parameter definition in this module looks like the following:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">parameter google = 4'hf;</code>
    </p><p>
      To override this value to a new value of 18, use the following option in the score command:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-P test.foo.a.google=18</code>
    </p><p>
      In this example, notice that we have not only changed the value of google, but we have also changed the bit-width of google from 4 bits to 32 bits
      (the size of an integer). This is considered legal behavior by Covered.
    </p><p>
      It is also possible to specify non-integer values to the parameter override option. Decimal, binary, octal and hexidecimal values may also be
      specified, using the same syntax as they are specified in Verilog. The following examples would also be other ways to override the value to 18.
    </p><p>
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  -P test.foo.a.google=5'b10010
  -P test.foo.a.google=4'o22
  -P test.foo.a.google=12'h12
  -P test.foo.a.google='d18
      </pre><p>
    </p><p>
      In fact, you may specify any value (with the exception of real numbers) to override a parameter, including the following value types: 'x', 'X', 'z',
      'Z', '_', '?'. This means that unknowns may be specified in a parameter. Note that this may generate user reported errors if parameters overridden
      to unknown values are used in mathematical equations or are used to specify the width of wires, regs, etc.
    </p><p>
      If a defparam statement is encountered in the DUT being scored, a warning message will be output to the user specifying that it has encountered a
      defparam statement. The defparam statement is ignored by Covered; however, if the parameter that it is overridding is used in the DUT being scored,
      the results of Covered may differ from actual simulation results. As such, please review all of these warning types to determine if the parameter
      should be overridden or not. If defparams are not parsed (seen by Covered), no such warning will be output. Please review the DUT for defparams
      which affect the DUT being scored.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.fsm"></a>9.6. Scoring FSMs</h2></div></div></div><p>
      At this time Covered does not have the ability to automatically extract FSM information from the design. As a result, it is up to the user to
      specify FSM information for Covered to use in scoring FSMs. The ability to automatically extract FSM information is planned to be supported in the
      future; however, it is always a good idea to allow the user to specify and potentially override Covered's automatic extraction in the case where
      Covered either misses an FSM or incorrectly determines logic to be an FSM in cases where none exists. The information specified in this section
      describes how to tell Covered where an FSM exists within the design as of the current development version of Covered.
    </p><p>
      First, we need to make a few assumptions about the type of FSMs that Covered will be able to handle and, in the future, identify.
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The FSM is a synchronous design with edge-triggered flip-flops.</p></li><li><p>There are no FSMs embedded in another FSM.</p></li><li><p>The FSM is not a pipe-lined system.</p></li><li><p>The entire FSM must exist within the same module.</p></li><li><p>All state registers/variables must be less than 2^16 bits in width.</p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      There is currently only one way, via the command-line, to specify to Covered where to find FSMs within the design. In the future, the inline
      Verilog-2001 "$attribute" function will be used to also allow the user to specify to Covered where an FSM is located. Using the command-line method,
      no changes need to be to source Verilog code for Covered's purposes.
    </p><p>
      To specify where an FSM exists within the design, the -F option must be specified to Covered's score command. Each -F option specifies one FSM
      within the design. Multiple -F options to the score command are allowed, allowing more than one FSM to be scored simultaneously. The -F option takes
      one argument that is subdivided into two or three parts:
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-F <span class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span>=(<span class="emphasis"><em>input_state_expression</em></span>,)<span class="emphasis"><em>output_state_expression</em></span></code>
    </p><p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span> specifies the Verilog module where the FSM state variables exist. The <span class="emphasis"><em>input_state_expression</em></span>
      specifies the name of the variable(s) that represent the input state of the state machine. The <span class="emphasis"><em>output_state_expression</em></span>
      specifies the name of the variable(s) that represent the output state of the state machine. Most FSMs have one variable as the input state (in most
      cases a registered version of the output state) such that the input variable is different than the output variable of the state machine. Specifying
      both variables in the -F option provides the user to more accurately specify to Covered the FSM. In the case that an FSM has the same variable for
      the input and output state, the user must specify only the output state variable (omitting the <span class="emphasis"><em>input_state_expression</em></span> and comma
      character in the argument).
    </p><p>
      The input and output expression to the -F command can represent any signals, parts of signals, or combinations of signals. Constant values or
      parameters in the specification of the input/output expression is currently not supported (in fact, there are no future plans to support this
      behavior unless user-feedback demands it). The following examples show various legal ways to specify input/output expressions. The syntax is limited
      to what it shown in these examples.
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-F foobar=a</code>
    </p><p>
      Example 1 specifies that the entire vector called "a" should be considered both the input and output state variable.
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-F foobar=a[2]</code>
    </p><p>
      Example 2 specifies that bit 2 of the vector called "a" should be considered both the input and output state variable.
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-F foobar=a[3:1]</code>
    </p><p>
      Example 3 specifies that bits 3:1 of the vector called "a" should be considered both the input and output state variable.
    </p><p>
      <code class="code">-F foobar={a,b}</code>
    </p><p>
      Example 4 specifies that vectors "a" and "b" should be concatenated to form the input/output state variable. Only one set of curly brackets may be
      used to specify a concatenated state expression; however, 2 or more signals may be specified within those brackets.
    </p><p>
      Any combination of the above four examples can be used to formalate the input state expression or the output state expression.
    </p><p>
      If the user specifies an FSM that Covered is not able to find (either the module was not included in the design that Covered is scoring or the FSM
      uses Verilog code that Covered is not able to handle), an error message is displayed to the user. It is then up to the user to determine if the FSM
      was incorrectly specified to Covered or otherwise. This warning is not considered to be a bug in Covered (unless of course, it can be proven that
      the FSM should have been found).
    </p><p>
      At the current time, Covered does not have the ability to extract the states and state transitions of the specified FSM from the design. Currently,
      it also doesn't have the ability to specify this information in other ways. To provide meaningful coverage information for the FSM, Covered outputs
      all hit states and state transitions in the report when all achievable states and state transitions are not known. This information will be able to
      be specified by the user in future versions of Covered, with the ability to automatically extract this information also in the works.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.conservative"></a>9.7. The reason for the -conservative feature</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Though Covered has support for many Verilog-1995, Verilog-2001 and SystemVerilog constructs there are handful of supported
      constructs that are dependent on correct simulation ordering to provide accurate coverage information.  In certain cases, Covered will
      be able to accurately determine the order of simulation, but in some cases, it may not.  In these cases, it is best for Covered to run
      in a "conservative" mode of operation whereby logic blocks that contain these code issues are removed from coverage consideration.
      Removing logic blocks does not have a negative impact (in terms of coverage accuracy) on the rest of the design.  The only negative
      consequence is that no coverage results can be obtained for a given logic block.
    </p><p>
      For example, consider the following code:
    </p><p>
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  module main;
    foo a();
    bar b();
  endmodule

  module foo;
    integer a;
    initial begin
      #10;
      a = $random;
    end
  endmodule

  module bar
    integer a;
    initial begin
      #5;
      a = $random;
    end
  endmodule
      </pre><p>
    </p><p>
      If only module "foo" is chosen to gather coverage information, the call to the $random function will result in a value
      that will not match the actual simulation if the <span class="bold"><strong>-conservative</strong></span> option is not specified.  This is
      due to the ordering importance of $random system task calls.  The first call to $random will return a value of X while the second
      call will return a value of Y.  If we remove the code that calls $random the first time, the code that still calls X will receive
      the incorrect value.  This discrepancy in simulation results will result in incorrect coverage results.
    </p><p>
      If the <span class="bold"><strong>-conservative</strong></span> option is specified to the score command, Covered will automatically remove any
      coverage blocks that make a call to the $random system function from coverage consideration and any assigned values within these
      removed blocks will get their value from the dumpfile instead of being calculated by Covered directly.  This will result in correct
      coverage information for the module "foo".
    </p><p>
      The constructs that can cause issues with Covered simulation correctness (in some situations) are the following:
    </p><p>
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>$random</p></li><li><p>$urandom</p></li><li><p>$urandom_range</p></li></ol></div><p>
    </p><p>
      It is currently up to the user to determine whether liberal or conservative coverage accumulation should occur and use
      the <span class="bold"><strong>-conservative</strong></span> option to the score command as needed.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.plusargs"></a>9.8. Specifying Plus Arguments When Scoring</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Covered supports the $test$plusargs and $value$plusargs system function calls and, as such, runtime command-line options are allowed to
      be specified when scoring the design.  To specify plusargs to the score command, simply specify them anywhere after the score command keyword
      just as you would specify them to a simulator.  Any plusargs specified to the score command which are not recognized for compilation purposes
      are used for $test$plusargs and $value$plusargs comparisons,
    </p><p>
      Note that specifying plusargs to the score command is only necessary when the score command is given either the -vcd, -lxt or -fst options.  If
      the VPI method of coverage scoring is used, specify the plusargs to the simulation runtime as required.  Covered will automatically extract
      the plusargs from the simulator runtime for its purposes.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="section.score.other"></a>9.9. Other Notes</h2></div></div></div><p>
      When the Verilog files are parsed, a preprocessor is run on each file that is to be read in by Covered. The preprocessor generates an intermediate
      form of each file, resolving defined values and included files. The intermediate form is output to a file which is called "tmpXXXXXX" where XXXXXX
      represents some alphanumeric sequence chosen by the OS via the mkstemp() function. The file is guaranteed to be unique to all other files in the
      directory and it is automatically removed by Covered when parsing is completed.
    </p><p>
      If the user does not want Covered to use this naming convention for specifying this file, the user may use the -p option (see Options section above)
      to override the default name. Covered will then use this filename instead of generating a unique name. Make sure that the file specified does not
      contain any useful data since Covered will overwrite this file when the score command is run.
