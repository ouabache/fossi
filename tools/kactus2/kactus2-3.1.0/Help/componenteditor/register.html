    <h2>Register editor</h2>
    <p>
      Register editor is used to edit the details of a single register and the possible bit fields within
      the register. A bit field may contain just one bit, the whole register or something in between.
      <br />In the elements, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>name</b>, <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information of a
      register. Name is mandatory and must be unique within the containing address block.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Offset</b> is a mandatory value to specify the location of the register from the start of the
        containing address block expressed as address units.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Width</b> is mandatory and defines the number of data bits the register contains. Width must be less 
        or equal to the <i>width</i> of the containing address block.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dimension</b> assigns an array dimension to the register. The register will be repeated in the
      address block as many times as indicated by the <i>dimension</i> value. Dimension 0 means
      that the register is not an array and will appear exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
	    <b>Is present</b> allows the enabling/disabling of a register presence in an address block. Value 
        1 indicates that the register is present in the address block whereas value 0 marks the register 
        to be treated as if it did not exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression, but 
        it must evaluate to 1 or 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Volatile</b> indicates whether the register value may change without a write operation to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> specifies the accessability of the register.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register. Only the
            first write transaction, after an event that caused the reset value of the register to be loaded, may
            affet the contents of the register, and read transactions return a value related to the values in the
            register.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of the register.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fields table</h3>
    <p>
      The fields table enables the user to define the register bit fields. A register must contain at least 
      one field.
      <br />A field has a unique <b>name</b> and a textual <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Offset</b> is a mandatory value to specify the starting bit of the field within the register.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Width</b> is a mandatory value to specify how many bits are included in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Volatile</b> indicates that there is no guarantee that two consecutive read operations will return
      the same value, as the register may change its value without write operations i.e. as a 
      result of an interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the field. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this field. Write
            transactions may affect the contents of the field, and read transactions return a value related to
            the field.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. A read transaction to this field returns a value related to the value in the field.
            A write transaction to this field has undefined results.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. A write transaction to this address affects the contents of the field. A read
            transaction to this field has undefined results.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this field. Only the
            first write transaction may affect the contents of the field, and read transactions return a value
            related to the values in the field.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of this field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Modified write value</b> describes how the data in the field is manipulated on a write operation. 
        The basic operation without any setting is to store the written value 'as is'. Moreover, both bitwise 
        and field-wise set/clear/toggle is also possbile. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>oneToClear</i>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '0'.</li>
      <li><i>oneToSet</i>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '1'.</li>
      <li><i>oneToToggle</i>. Each written '1' bit will toggle the corresponding bit.</li>
      <li><i>zeroToClear, zeroToSet, zeroToToggle</i>. Similar to previous ones, except that written '0' bit
        triggers the action.</li>
      <li><i>clear</i>. Each write operation will clear all bits in the field to '0'.</li>
      <li><i>set</i>. Each write operation will set all bits in the field to '1'.</li>
      <li><i>modify</i>. Indicates that after a write operation all bits in the field can be modified.</li>
      <li><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i>. Indicates that the value written to a field is the value stored in the
        field. This is the default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Read action</b> specifies if some action happens to the
      field after a read operation. By default the register is
      unmodified. the possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>clear</i>. All bits in the field are cleared to '0' after a read operation.</li>
      <li><i>set</i>. All bits in the field are set to '1' after a read operation.</li>
      <li><i>modify</i>. Indicates that the bits in the field are modified in some way after a read operation.</li>
      <li><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i>. Indicates that field is not modified after a read operation. This is
        the default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Testable</b> specifies if the field is testable by an automated register test.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Test constraint</b> specifies the constraints for the automated tests for the field. 
      The possible constraint values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>unConstrained</i>. There are no constrains for the written or read data. This is the default
            setting.</li>
        <li><i>restore</i>. The field's value must be restored to its original value before accessing another
            register.</li>
        <li><i>writeAsRead</i>. The data written to a field must be the same that was read previously from the
            field.</li>
        <li><i>readOnly</i>. Indicates that the field can only be read.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Is present</b> enables/disables a field's presence in a register. Value 1 indicates that the field 
        is present in the register whereas value 0 marks the field to be treated as if it did not exist. Is 
        present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression, but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.
