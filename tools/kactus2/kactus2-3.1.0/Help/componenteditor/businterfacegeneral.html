    <h2>Bus interface editor</h2>
    <p>
      Bus interface editor is used to edit the details of a single
      bus interface. <i>Bus interface</i> is used to group ports
      together to form an interface that i.e. fulfills requirements
      for a bus protocol. The editor contains two tabs: the
      <b>general</b> tab which is used to set the general settings of
      the interface, and the <b>port maps</b> tab which is used to
      group ports to the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bus interface has a mandatory <b>name</b>, an optional <b>display name</b> and textual <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Interface mode</b> combo box has 7 choices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Master</b> for initiating transactions.</li>
        <li><b>Slave</b> for responding to transactions.</li>
        <li><b>System</b> for defining interfaces not belonging to either master or slave interface modes.</li>
        <li><b>MirroredMaster</b> is the mirrored version of a master interface.</li>
        <li><b>MirroredSlave</b> is the mirrored version of a slave interface.</li>
        <li><b>MirroredSystem</b> is the mirrored version of a system interface.</li>
        <li><b>Monitor</b> for verification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Settings in the right side of the bus interface are interface mode-specific and change when mode changes. 
        For example, <i>master</i> and <i>mirroredMaster</i> have address space settings, whereas <i>slave</i> has 
        memory map and bridge settings.
    </p>
    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Addressable unit size</b> defines how many bits are included in the least addressable unit of the bus 
      interface.  The default setting is byte addressable (8 bits).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Endianness</b> indicates whether the interface is 'big-endian' or 'little-endian' (default).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bit steering</b>='on' implies that the interface is able to dynamically align data on different byte 
      channels in case of addressable interfaces. The default setting when the bit steering is not set is off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Connection required</b> indicates that when instantiated in a design, this interface must be connected 
      to some other interface and cannot be left unconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bus definition</b> and <b>abstraction definition</b> contain <i>VLNV</i>-references to IP-XACT documents 
      that are associated with this interface. They define the qualities that this bus interface must meet. The 
      abstraction definition defines the <i>logical signals</i> and port maps define how they are connected to 
      component's ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Parameters</b> are optional and can specify any parameter
      data value(s) for this bus interface. For more information, see component parameter editor.
