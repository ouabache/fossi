    <h2>Memory map editor</h2>
    <p>
      Memory map editor can be used to edit the details of a <i>memory map</i>. The <b>name</b>,
      <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information of a memory map.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>address unit bits</b> [AUB] defines the number of data bits each address increment of the 
      memory map contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Remap state</b> identifies the name of the remap state for which the optional memory map elements
        are active. <i>Memory maps</i> are labeled with a default remap state, while <i>memory remaps</i> must be 
        given a remap state. For more information on the <i>remap states</i>, see the remap states editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory map is defined for a <b>slave interface</b>. It defines what the masters can access in this
      component.
    </p>
    <h3>Address blocks table</h3>
    <p>
    <b>Address block</b> specifies a single contiguous block, either a set of registers or a block of memory.
    (Moreover, IP-XACT allows <i>bank</i> or <i>subspaceMap</i> elements, but
    they are not yet supportted by Kactus (v2.1, March 2013)).
    <br />An <i>address block</i> can contain <b>registers</b> and each register can contain <b>bit fields</b>. 
    <br />Address block has the following mandatory elements: name, base address, range, and width.
    <br />In the columns, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Address block has a <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b> to identify each address block.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Base address</b> specifies the starting address for the address block. It is expressed as
    <i>address unit bits</i> as defined in the containing memory map, e.g. 8b or 32b.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Range</b> and specifies the size of the block in <i>address unit bits</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Width</b> is the data width in bits of a row in the address block. It sets the maximum allowed 
    size of a single transfer and also defines the maximum size of a single register. Register can be 
    smaller but not wider.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Usage</b> column is used to specify the usage of the address block. The possible values are:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Memory</i> specifies the address block as memory. Cannot
      contain registers.</li>

      <li><i>Register</i> specifies the entire block to contain
      registers.</li>

      <li><i>Reserved</i> specifies the entire block as reserved for
      usage that is unknown to IP-XACT. Cannot include registers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Access</b> column is used to specify the accessibility of the block. The possible values are:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address block.</li>
            <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
            <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
            <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Read actions are allowed and the first write action may have an effect on 
            this address block.</li>
            <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address block.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b>=true indicates that the stored value may
        change without master's write operation. For example, the timer
        value gets updated automatically and master must always issue a
        read to get the latest value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Memory maps visualization</b> is shown on the right of the editor. The visualization can be expandped
        and minimized by clicking the expand arrow <img src="../images/triangle_arrow_right.png" alt="expand"> 
        and the minimize arrow <img src="../images/triangle_arrow_down.png" alt="minimize">. Selecting any part
        of the visualization will open the editor set for that item.

      EXAMPLE. A simple IP could have 1 memory map, 1 address block
      inside it, and three 32-bit registers: ctrl, data_in, and
      data_out. Ctrl allows both read and write accesses, data_in is
      write-only, and data_out is read-only.  The lower part of ctrl
      register is divided into two 8-bit fields and designer can
      describe how they are used. The upper bits are not used. Data
      registers do not have field definitions.


      <br><br>Number of Addresss unit bits(AUB) of the memory map is
      set to 8 bits.  There are 3 registers with identical size (32b),
      Hence, ranger = 12 = 3 * 32/AU = 3 * 32/8 = 3 * 4. Let's assume
      base addr=0x100.  Since address block has 12 Bytes in total, it
      reserves the (byte) addresses 0x100-0x10B. It is good to set the
      width of the address block 32 b so that full register can be
      accessed at once. Smaller accesses (e.g. 1 byte at a time) are
      also allowed.
