		<h2>Field editor</h2>
		<p>
			The field editor is used to edit the details of a field. For example user may define enumerated	
            values that define the legal bit patterns of a field.
            <br />In the elements, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>name</b>, <b>display name</b> and the <b>description</b> contain identification
            information of a register.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Offset</b> describes the starting bit of the field within the containing register (mandatory).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Width</b> speficies how many bits are included in the field (mandatory).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Is present</b> enables/disables a field's presence in a register. Value 1 indicates that the 
            field is present in the register whereas value 0 marks the field to be treated as if it did not
            exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression, but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.
        </p>
        <p>
	        <b>Reset value</b> defines the actual reset value on reset. <i>Reset value</i> uses SystemVerilog 
            syntax for binary values. The number of bits must be equal to the register <i>size</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Reset mask</b> defines the bits that have a known reset value. Bit value of 1 means that the 
            corresponding bit has a known reset value whereas 0 means that the value is unknown. 
            <i>Reset mask</i> uses SystemVerilog syntax for binary values e.g. 'b1011, 4'b1011, and 4'b10_11 
            are all valid values. The number of bits must be equal to the register <i>size</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Volatile</b> = true indicates that the register may change its value without write operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Access</b> specifies the accessability of the field. The possible values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this field. Write
                transactions may affect the contents of the field, and read transactions return a value related to
                the field.</li>
            <li><i>read-only</i>. A read transaction to this field returns a value related to the value in the
                field. A write transaction to this field has undefined results.</li>
            <li><i>write-only</i>. A write transaction to this address affects the contents of the field. A read
                transaction to this field has undefined results.</li>
            <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this field. Only the
                first write transaction may affect the contents of the field, and read transactions return a value
                related to the values in the field.</li>
            <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of this field.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Modified write value</b> describes how the data in the field is manipulated on a write operation.
            The basic operation without any setting is to store the written value 'as is'. Moreover, both bitwise
            and field-wise set/clear/toggle is also possible. The possible values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>oneToClear</i>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '0'.</li>
            <li><i>oneToSet</i>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '1'.</li>
            <li><i>oneToToggle</i>. Each written '1' bit will toggle the corresponding bit.</li>
            <li><i>zeroToClear, zeroToSet, zeroToToggle</i>. Similar to previous ones, except that written '0' bit
                triggers the action.</li>
            <li><i>clear</i>. Each write operation will clear all bits in the field to '0'.</li>
            <li><i>set</i>. Each write operation will set all bits in the field to '1'.</li>
            <li><i>modify</i>. Indicates that after a write operation, all bits in the field can be modified.</li>
            <li><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i>. Indicates that the value written to a field is the value stored
                in the field. This is the default value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Read action</b> specifies if some action happens to the field after a read operation. By default the
                register is unmodified. The possible values are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>clear</i>. All bits in the field are cleared to '0' after a read operation.</li>
            <li><i>set</i>. All bits in the field are set to '1' after a read operation.</li>
            <li><i>modify</i>. Indicates that the bits of the field are modified in some way after a read
                operation.</li>
            <li><i>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</i>. Indicates that the field is not modified after a read operation.
                This is the default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Testable</b> specifies if the field is testable by an automated register test.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Test constraint</b> specifies the constaints for the automated tests for the field. The possible
            values are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>unConstrained</i>. There are no constraints for the written or read data. This is the
                default setting.</li>
            <li><i>Restore</i>. The fields value must be restored to its original value before accessing
                another register.
            </li>
            <li><i>WriteAsRead</i>. The data written to a field must be same that was read previously from
                the field</li>
            <li><i>ReadOnly</i>. Indicates that the field can only be read.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        	The <b>write value constraint</b>s are used to define what are the legal values user may write to a
            field The possible values are:
            <ul>
                <li><i>No constraints</i>. Indicates that there are no constraints to values to be written.</li>
                <li><i>Write as read</i>. Inidcates that only legal values to be written are the same that were
                    previously read from the field.</li>
                <li><i>Use enumerated values</i>. Indicates that the defined enumerated values are the only legal
                    values that can be written.</li>
                <li><i>Set minimum and maximum limits</i>. Indicates that the minimum and maximum limits can be set
                    for the value written to the field.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Enumerations table</h3>
		<p>
			The enumerated values table enables the defining of  bit patterns that can be identified by a name. 
			This can be used to define the legal bit patterns for a field or to define some default settings 
			to help configuration of the field.
		</p>
        <p>
            Each enumeration contains a unique <b>name</b> of the enumeration (mandatory), an optional 
            <b>display name</b> and <b>description</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Value</b> defines the value to assign to the specified name (mandatory).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Usage</b> defines the software access condition under which this name value pair is valid.
            Possible values are: <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> and <i>read-write</i>.
