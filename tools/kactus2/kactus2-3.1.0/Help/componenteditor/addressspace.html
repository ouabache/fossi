    <h2>Address space editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address space editor can be used to edit the details of an
      address space within component.  <i>Address space</i> defines a
      logical address space seen by a master bus interface. It can be
      split into smaller <i>sgements</i>.
      <br />In the elements, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.  
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left side are the editor fields that can be used to set
      the details of an address space.  The right side contains a
      visualization displaying the address space in its current state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Address space has a unique <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>.
      <b>Display name</b> can be more detailed or user-friendly than
      name, but usually only a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general group contains the same settings that can be set through the address spaces summary.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Addressable unit bits</b> (AUB) specifies the number of bits each address increment contains, 
        e.g. 8 bits or 32 bits. The AUB is mandatory if the address space contains a local memory map.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Range</b> is the size of the address space expressed as addressable units, i.e. the number of
      separate addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Width</b> is the data width of a row in bits. It defines the maximum size for a single transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Master interface binding</b> ties the address space to a master interface. The binding can be set
        in the <i>bus interface</i> editor.
    </p>
    <h3>Segments</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Segments</b> editor can be used to describe portions of the address space, i.e. split it into smaller
        segments. Elements with an f(x) can be given as an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each segment has the starting <b>offset</b> address, given in address unit bits, a <b>range</b> (size) 
      given in AUBs, and a textual <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visualization on the right side reacts to the changes and displays how the segments are situated in 
      the address space. Mismatches, e.g. sum of segment ranges being greater than address block range, can 
      be easily spotted from the visualization.
    </p>
    <h3>Local memory map</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Local memory map</b> is optional but some processors require specifying a memory map that is local
      to the component.  This consists of <b>Address blocks</b> similarly to the memory map of a slave
      interface. Hence, address blocks can contain either memory or registers, and registers can contain bit
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local memory map is useful for storing the programmer's view to interrupts registers, timers,
      and other local things. The overall address space of a component is a concatenation of local memory map
      (e.g. timers) and the memory maps of other units (e.g. registers of accelerator A, registers of
      accelerator B etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The address block editor can be used to define address blocks for the address space. The editor is
      similar to the address blocks table in <i>memory map</i> editor.
