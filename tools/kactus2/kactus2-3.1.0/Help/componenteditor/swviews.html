    <h2>Software views editor</h2>
    <p>
      This is Kactus extension <br><img src="../images/appicon.png">
      <br><br> <i>SW views</i> are usually associated with a CPU
      component. They define which application-independent SW, such as
      operating system or device drivers, are available.  User selects
      which SW view is <i>active</i>, e.g.  uCos, uCLinux or not OS at
      all, for each CPU In <i>system design</i>. The structure of a
      view is captured with <i>SW design</i> which also a
      Kactus-extension and saved in its own XML file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each SW view has mandatory <b>name</b> and <b>hierarchy
      reference</b>. Note that the latter cannot be edited here, but
      in view's own editor. Note also that a SW view is always
      hierarchical, unlike regualr <i>view</i>.<b>Display name</b> is
      optional and typically a few words providing a more detailed
      and/or user-friendly name for display. Optional
      <b>description</b> contains a textual description of the
      interface.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLE. GizmoCPU has a software stack that has three
    components: DMA driver and two components for implementing
    MCAPI. The SW view points to s SW design which instantiates and
    connects these three together. Note that the same SW structure
    could be captured also in <i>system design</i>, but doing it like
    this simplifies reuse. SW views becomes especially handy when
    GizmoCPU supports multiple SW stacks. <img
