- Fixed the error of changes being applied without saving when editing
  hierarchical interfaces of a design.
- Inout ports are now directly mapped to component instance ports as opposed
  to using signals which did not work as expected.

* General page is now shown by default in the component editor.
* Designs can now be browsed and component details previewed even if
  the document is locked.
* Appropriate editor windows on the right side are now automatically
  shown/hidden when an element is selected or deselected on a design.
* Configuration editor is now hidden for other editors than the HW design
  editor.
* Unnecessary ribbon groups are now hidden automatically based on the open
  editor.
* Changed the report generator to categorize ports under bus interfaces
  instead of one long list.
