Connection has a mandatory <b>name</b> and      optional textual <b>description</b>. The connection name forms      the basis for signal names in the generated VHDL.    </p>    <p> Most information in this editor is provided for checking and    cannot be edited here, e.g. <b>bus interface</b> and    <b>abstaction</b> VLNV's are defined in graphical    diagram. <b>Connected ports</b> are derived from these VLNVs and    the associated ports maps in the connected components.    </p></body></html>
