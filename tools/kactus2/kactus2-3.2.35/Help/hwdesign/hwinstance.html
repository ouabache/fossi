Optional <b>display name</b> is shown      in the graphical block diagram. Optional <b>description</b> can      be used for freetext comments.      <br>      <b>Configurable element values</b> are instance-specific values      set from <i>model parameters</i> (such as VHDL generics) and      component <i>parameters</i> of the component. There is a context	  menu (right mouse button) to clear, copy and paste cells.    </p>     <p> <b>Ad-hoc visibility</b> window control how graphical block    diagram looks like. Component symbols show <i>bus interfaces</i>    by default, but individual <i>ports</i> are also shown, if they    are marked as <b>ad-hoc</b>.    </p>    <p>      <b> Design configuration</b> is additional      information about an IP-XACT design. Each design can have      multiple configurations. Design configuration defines which is      the <b>active view</b> if component has many (such as simulation      and synthesis). Settings for generator chains or interface      abstractor are not yet implemented in Kactus</li>      </p>      </body></html>
