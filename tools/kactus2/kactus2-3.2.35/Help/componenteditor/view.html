    <h2>View editor</h2>
    <p>
        <i>View</i> specifies a representation level of a component, e.g. there might be different views for 
        simulation and synthesis. This editor is used to edit the details of single view.
    </p>
    <p>
        View has <b>name</b> and textual <b>description</b>. <b>Display name</b> can be more detailed or 
        user-friendly than name, but usually only few words.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Environment identifiers</b> in mandatory textual information about how this view is deployed in 
        different tool environments.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Language</b> indicates this view may be compatible with a particular tool, but only if that 
            language is supported in that tool, e.g., different versions of some simulators may support two or 
            more languages.</li>

            <li><b>Tool</b> indicates that this view contains tool-information, e.g., HDL models that use 
            simulator-specific extensions. The tool can have a generic value such as "*Simulation" and 
            "*Synthesis".</li>

            <li><b>VendorSpecific</b> can further qualify tool and language compatibility, e.g. if some 
            appropriate simulator mode must be enabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Instantiations</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Component instantiation</b> specifies the referenced <i>component instantiation</i>. Data regarding 
        the selected component instantiation is displayed in the view editor. For more information on the 
        component instantiation, see the component instantiation editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Design configuration instantiation</b> specifies the referenced <i>design configuration 
        instantiation</i>. Data regarding the selected design configuration instantiation is displayed in the view
        editor. For more information on the design configuration instantiation, see the design configuration 
        instantiation editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Design instantiation</b> details the referenced <i>design instantiation</i>. Data regarding the selected
        design instantiation is displayed in the view editor. For more information on the design instantiation, see
        the design instantiation editor.
    </p>
    <h3>Module parameters</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Module parameters</b> are optional elements that configure the model for this view. In IP-XACT, module
        parameters are an element of the component instantiation. For convinience, they can be viewed in the view 
        editor. The module parameters can be utilized as view-specific <i>parameters</i>. For further information 
        on module parameters, see the component instantiation editor.
