    <h2>System views editor</h2>
    <p>
      This is Kactus extension <br><img
      src="../images/appicon.png"><br><br> <i>System view</i> is a
      usually associated with a component including multiple CPUs. It
      is hierarchical reference to <i>system design</i> which is also
      a Kactus-extension and defines the mapping of SW onto HW
      resources.  One component, such as multiprocessor SoC (MPSoC),
      can have multiple system views, i.e. multiple stored mappings,
      and hence it is easy to switch between them. System design
      defines how SW is mapped onto CPUs and it shows all HW
      components that include a <i>CPU definition</i>. Mapping is
      necessary if there are multiple CPUs or HW accelerators that
      support the optional COM interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each system view has mandatory <b>name</b> and <b>hierarchy
      reference</b>. Note that the latter cannot be edited here, but
      in view's own editor. Note also that a system view is always
      hierarchical, unlike regular <i>view</i>.<b>Display name</b> is
      optional and typically a few words providing a more detailed
      and/or user-friendly name for display. Optional
      <b>description</b> contains a textual description of the
      interface.

    <hr>
    <p>EXAMPLE. A product includes two porgrammable CPUS: Nios on FPGA
    and a regular PC. One system design performs the application
    mapping so that discrete cosine transfrom (dct) is executed on PC
    whereas the main function H.263 video encoder is on
    Nios. Communication between these is done using MCAPI endpoints
    and channels. Therefore Nios also includes the MCAPI SW component.
    We notice that interface symbols are different in COM interfaces
    (main - dct) and API interfaces (main - mcapi). Note also that
    system design shows CPUs together although they appear on
    different levels of product's hiearchy. <br><img
