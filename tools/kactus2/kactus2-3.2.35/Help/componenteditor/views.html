    <h2>Views editor</h2>
    <p>
      Views editor provides a summary of the views of the
      component. The editor can be used to add and remove views.
      <i>View</i> specifies a representation level of a component,
      e.g. there might be different views for simulation and
      synthesis. Component must have at least 1 view. It can also have
      many views and one of them activated when component is
      instantiated in a <i>design</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name</b> and <b>description</b> columns are used to define a view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>View type</b> is not editable in this editor, but it is determined in the view editor of the 
      corresponding view. The view type defines whether the view is <i>hierarchical</i> or not. Hierarchical view 
      contains a reference to a <i>design</i> or <i>design configuration</i> which instantiates sub-components 
      and connects them together. <i>Non-hierarchical</i> view refers to 1 or multiple file sets within the 
      containing component.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor contains a context menu that contains following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new view (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove view (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Views that are currently in an <font color="red"> invalid
	state</font> are displayed in <font color="red">red</font>.
    </p>

    <p>
      EXAMPLE. Component can have many views, for example one that
      refers to fileset(s) and the other that refers to a design.<br>
