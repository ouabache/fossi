    <h2>Software properties editor</h2>
    <p>
      This is Kactus extension <br><img
      src="../images/appicon.png"><br><br> These allow defining
      parameters for software. The usage is similar to <i>model
      parameters</i>, first define the available parameters and then
      give them actual values upon component instantiation. However,
      these are separated, since other tools do not have such concept
      and that might lead confusion which are HW parameters and and
      which are SW parameters.  </p>
    <p> 
      Each SW property has mandatory <b>name</b> and <b>type</b>
      (string, integer, IP address). Moreover, sometimes the value
      definition is <b>required</b> on each instance. Optional
      <b>default value</b> is used, if instance does not specify the
      value. Textual <b>desciption</b> is also optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, MCAPI nodes necessiate that user sets the 'node_id'
      which is done through SW property. Similarly, some SW may need
      the IP address of itself or other device and it can be also set
      here.
