<p>You may also customize what is seen in the component editor, while using a workspace:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open settings.</li>
<li>Select <i>Component Editor Visibilities</i>.</li>
<li>Choose workspace which you wish to customize.</li>
<li>For instance, you may decide that product level components do not need external interfaces.</li>
<li>As another example, you may decide that since this workspace is reserved for software work, it does not need other clock drivers.</li>
</ol>
