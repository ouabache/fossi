    <h2>COM Definition</h2>
    <p>
        COM definitions are used to define more strictly the connections that relate to higher-level communication between HW/SW components in a system design.
		COM definition consists of two types of information: <b>transfer types</b> and <b>properties</b>.
    </p>
	<p>
	   <b>Transfer types</b> is an enumeration of possible data types that define what kind of data can be communicated between components via connections that are based on this COM definition.
	   The used transfer type for each COM interface in a component is selected in the component editor.
	</p>
	<p>
	   <b>Properties</b> offer a way to define certain variables whose value must be set for each COM interface.
	   Properties can be either required or optional. COM definition defines the data type and default value for each of the properties.
