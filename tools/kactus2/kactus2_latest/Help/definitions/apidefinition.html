    <h2>API Definition</h2>
    <p>
        API definitions are used to define API dependencies between SW components in more detail.
        API definition wraps an SW library or other API to offer more thorough validation for or
        both software and system designs and to provide context-sensitive content assistance in
        the code editor. API definition consists of three types of information:
    </p>
	<p>
        <b>Data types</b> define all data types the API makes available for use in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>COM definition reference</b> can be used to reference a COM definition in order to
        use its transfer types and properties in the function definitions so that the content
        assist in the code editor can give more detailed assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Functions</b> list is filled with all functions that the API contains. For each
        function, all its parameters are defined in detail, including any restrictions that
        depend on the referenced COM definition.
