      <br /><b>Description</b> shows a used given description regarding the currently active file.
      <br /><b>File types</b> list specifies the type of the file. File type can be used i.e. when specifying
      build commands for a group of files. A file can have multiple file types.
    </p>
    <h3>General options</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Logical name</b> specifies e.g. a VHDL library where the VHDL-file will be compiled to.
      <br />If the checkbox <b>generators can override logical name </b> is ticked, the logical name can be 
        overridden by another process. If the check box is unticked, then this logical name cannot be overrriden.
      <br />The check box <b>File is structural RTL</b> informs that the file is a structural
        <i>register transfer level</i> file.

      <br /><b>Flags</b> can either <b>replace default flags</b> (e.g. those specified for this file type) 
        in the build script or be appended to them. The value for <i>replace default flags</i> can be given as an
