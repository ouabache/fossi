    <h2>CPUs editor</h2>
    <p>
      The cpus editor lists the programmable cores the component
      contains. This way the tools can recognize them and distinguish
      from hardwired components. One component can have many cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each CPU has a mandatory <b>name</b> and optional textual
      <b>description</b>. <b>Address space</b> references specify the
      logical address space of the cpu. When a <i>master interface</i>
      of a component references the same address spaces, there's a
      link link between the programmable core and the interface. This
      information helps in generating a board support
      package (BSP) and picking appropriate programmable components
      into system design. CPU definition should not be repeated on a
      higher level component (one that instantiates a CPU).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cpus editor provides a context menu (right mouse button) with
      the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new cpu (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove cpu (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>

      EXAMPLE. Example SoC has two CPUs. Both refer to an address
      space. The first address space is bound to a master interface
      whereas the second is local. Consequently, cpuA has access to
      the upper master interface and cpuB does not.  <br><img
