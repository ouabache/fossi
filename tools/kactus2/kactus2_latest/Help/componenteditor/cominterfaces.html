    <h2>COM interfaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      This is Kactus extension <br><img
      src="../images/appicon.png"><br><br> <i>COM interface</i> means
      that component supports an optional "high-level" communication
      mechanism, such as MCAPI. Purpose is to increase portability by
      abstacting the details of communication. COM interfaces are
      connected together in <b>system view</b> of the Kactus. Usually,
      these interfaces a part of a SW component, but some HW
      components can support them also. COM interfaces makes only
      loose coupling between SW components, and consequently the
      receiver can be mapped on different CPU than sender. COM
      interfaces are meant for communication between application
      modules, whereas API interfaces are mainly between application
      and platform (OS, drivers) and inside the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each interface has a mandatory <b>name</b> and <b>direction</b>
      (in, out, inout). Optional <b>COM definition</b> is an XML
      document that captures the interface properties, similarly to
      bus interfaces in regular HW components. Note that this
      information is just shown here and can be edited on interface
      editor.  Optional <b>transfer type</b> denotes what kind of data
      is transmitted through the interface. The allowed values depend
      on the selected COM definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a SW component could have an input COM interface
      'data_in' and output called 'result_out'. Then depending of how
      the channels are conencted in system design, the imput data can
      come from, say, UART or CPU. Similarly, the result can be
      directed to, say, memory or VGA. Here both interfaces correspond
      to MCAPI endpoints and transmit 'MCAPI messages'.<br> <img
