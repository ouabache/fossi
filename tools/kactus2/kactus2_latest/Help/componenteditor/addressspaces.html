    <h2>Address spaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains the summary of the address spaces
      of the component. This editor can be used to add and remove
      address spaces to the containing component. Double-click adds a new <b>address space</b>.
      <br />In the elements, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Address space</b> defines the addressable memory space that can be accessed via a <i>master
      interface</i>. It is the programmer's view to the rest of the system.
      <br />Note that address spaces are actually instance-specific concepts (what other units are 
      there and what are their addresses) rather than component-specific. Nevertheless, IP-XACT standard 
      defines address space inside a component, although it is seldom a reusable element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each address space has a mandatory unique <b>name</b> and an optional textual <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Addressable unit bits</b> specifies the number of bits each address increment contains, 
      e.g. 8 bits or 32 bits. The AUB is mandatory if the address space contains a local memory map default 
      AUB is 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Range</b> (mandatory) means the size of the address space expressed as addressable units. In other 
      words, it is the number of separate addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Width</b> (mandatory) is the data width of a row in bits, defining the maximum size for a single transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Master interface binding</b> ties the address space to a master interface. The binding can be set in 
      the <i>bus interface</i> editor.

      <li>Remove address space (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
