    <h2>General editor</h2>
    <p>
      General editor contains the general information of a <i>component</i>.
    </p>
    <p>      
      <i>VLNV</i>-identifier and the file path to the xml-file are
      shown on top. These fields cannot be modified after
      creation. Changes require that the component must be saved as
      new component with new VLNV. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Kactus attributes</b> help to classify and categorize one's
      IPs. They are Kactus2-specific extension to the IP-XACT standard
      and describe the level (single IP vs. system), implementation
      style, and whether modification is allowed. Only the
      implementation style applies for SW components.  <br><img

    <p>
        <b>Author</b> displays the author of the component.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Description</b> text box can store a textual description of the component.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>XML header</b> shows and allows editing the comment lines in
      the beginning of XML file, i.e. those inside tags &lt;!-- and
      --&gt;.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Component preview</b> box on the right side of the editor displays how the component will look like when
      instantiated in a design. The preview displays the <i>bus interfaces</i> of the component and also the
      <i>ports</i> that are marked as <i>ad-hoc</i>.
