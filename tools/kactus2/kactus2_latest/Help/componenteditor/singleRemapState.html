    <h2>Single remap state editor</h2>
    <p>
      Remap state editor is used to edit the details of a single remap state.
      A <i>Remap state</i> defines a conditional remap state where each state
      is conditioned by a remap port specified with a <b>Remap Port</b> element.
      A <i>remap state</i> element does not specify remapping addresses. The
      remapping addresses are defined by the <b>memory remap</b> element (of a
      <b>memory map</b> element), and its state attribute referes to the <b>remap
      state</b> element's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remap state contains a name group, defining any descriptive text for the
      containing element. The name group contains the following elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name</b> identifies the containing element.</li>
      <li><b>Display name</b> allows a short descriptive text to be associated
      with the containing element.</li>
      <li><b>Description</b> allows a textual description of the containing element.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to the name group, a remap state contains a remap state condition,
      which is specified with <b>remap port</b> elements. These elements make up the
      condition for this remap state. All elements should be true for the remap state to
      be enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Port</b> contains the names of the selected remap ports. These remap ports are
      selected among the components ports. No port can be selected twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Left bound</b> column contains the left bound value of the selected port.
      This value cannot be given, as it is read using the selected port. Together with
      the value of the right bound column, this value is used to calculate the width of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Right bound</b> column contains the right bound value of the selected port.
      This value cannot be given, as it is read using the selected port. Together with
      the value of the left bound column, this value is used to calculate the width of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Value</b> contains the value necessary so the specified port activates the
      <i>remap state</i>. Depending on the width of the port, the remap condition value may be given as a single
      expression for the whole port, or as separate expressions for each bit of the port. A port with a width of 1
      is only allowed to receive a single expression.
