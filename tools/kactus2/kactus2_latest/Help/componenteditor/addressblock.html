    <h2>Address block editor</h2>
    <p>
        Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address block and the registers contained within 
        it.
        <br />In the elements, f(x) means that the value can be given as an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>name</b>, <b>display name</b> and a <b>description</b> contain identification information
        of the address block. Name is mandatory and must be unique within all the address blocks of the 
        containing memory map.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Base address</b> is mandatory and specifies the starting address for the address block expressed in
        <i>address unit bits</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Range</b> is mandatory and specifies the size of the block expressed in <i>address units bits</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Width</b> is mandatory and defines the data width of a row in the address block. The width value is 
            given in bits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Usage</b> is a mandatory value to specify the usage of the address block and may have one of the
            following values:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Register</i> The address block range may contain registers.</li>
            <li><i>Memory</i> The address block range is ROM, RAM or write-only memory as defined by 
                <i>access</i> and shall not contain registers.</li>
            <li><i>Reserved</i> The address block is reserved for other usage and shall not contain registers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> specifies the accessability of the address block. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address block.</li>
        <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Read actions and the first write action may have an effect on this address
            block.</li>
        <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> indicates whether the stored value may change without the master's write operation.
    </p>
    <h3>Registers table</h3>
    <p>
      The register table enables the user to define registers for the address block, with each row representing a 
      single register. Each register must also contain at least one bit field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each register has a unique <b>name</b> and an optional <b>description</b> for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Offset</b> is mandatory and specifies the location of the register from the start of the containing 
        address block expressed as number of addressing units. The actual address of the register is the sum 
        of address block's base address and the register offset. E.g. if the base address is 'h100 and the 
        register offset is 'h4, the register's address is 'h104. Offset can be given as a SystemVerilog 
        expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Size</b> is mandatory and defines the number of data bits the register contains. Size must be less than 
            or equal to the <i>width</i> of the containing address block.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dimension</b> assigns an array dimension to the register. The register will be repeated in the
            address block as many times as indicated by the <i>dimension</i> value. By default, the dimension is 
            presumed to be 0. Dimension 0 means that the register is not an array and will appear exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> indicates whether the register value may change without a write operation to it, 
        i.e. by an interrupt event.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Access</b> column specifies the accessibility of the register. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>read-write</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-only</i>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>write-only</i>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
      <li><i>read-writeOnce</i>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this register. Only the
          first write transaction, after an event that caused the reset value of the register to be loaded, may
          affet the contents of the register, and read transactions return a value related to the values in the
          register.</li>
      <li><i>writeOnce</i>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of the register.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
      <b>Is present</b> allows the enabling/disabling of a register presence in an address block. 
      Value 1 indicates that the register is present in the address block whereas value 0 marks 
      the register to be treated as if it did not exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog 
      expression, but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.
