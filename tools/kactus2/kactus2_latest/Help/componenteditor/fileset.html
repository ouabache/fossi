    <h2>File set editor</h2>
    <p>
      File set editor can be used to edit the details of a single file set. These file sets can be used to 
      group files together to be referenced by other sections of a component.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Name</b>, <b>display name</b>, and <b>description</b> of the
      file set are shown on top. Name is mandatory as it identifies
      the file set within a component. Display name is typically a few
      words providing a more detailed and/or user-friendly name for
      display. Description contains a textual description of the file
      set.
    </p>
    <h3>Group identifiers</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Group identifier</b> can be used to describe the function or purpose of the file set with a single
      unbounded word. <i>Group identifiers</i> can contain several identifiers and the number of possible 
      identifiers is not limited. However, the editor suggests the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnostics</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
      <li>ProjectFiles</li>
      <li>Simulation</li>
      <li>sourceFiles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Files</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Files</b> editor lists the files contained within the file set.
      Each file has a <b>name</b> identifying the file. The name is mandatory and it is determined automatically 
      from the file path.
      <br /><b>File path</b> is defined either as relative to the component's xml-file, as an absolute path or as 
      an external URI. If an URI is used, the schema must be explicitly defined (e.g. http://...). 
      The file path is mandatory.
      <br /><b>File type</b> links files to their build command (see below). File type is mandatory, and one 
      file can have many types.
      <br /><b>Description</b> is a freely formatted text describing a single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      New files can be added by creating new rows, browsing the files using the context menu option described below
      or by drag-dropping the files onto the editor. If the order of files is important for e.g. compilation then 
      the files should be listed in the required order. The order of the files can be changed by dragging the rows.
      <br>If a file is in <font color="red">invalid state</font>, for e.g. missing a mandatory file type, then the
      file is displayed in <font color="red">red color</font>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The files box also contains a context menu (right mouse button) that has the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new files to the file set by browsing the file system (Add file(s)...)</li>
      <li>Add new file to the file set (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove file from file set (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Default build commands</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Default build command</b> defines how to build the files within the file set by e.g. running gcc
      for C files or vcom for VHDL.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>File type</b> defines which files are build by the given <b>command</b>.
      <br /><b>Flags</b> define the command line options for the <i>command</i> e.g. -Wall.
      <br />The defined command can either <b>replace default flags</b> defined in the target <i>file</i> or be 
      appended to it. The <i>replace default flags</i> value can be given as an expression, but must evaluate
      either to 1 or 0.
      <br />This table has a similar context menu as the files editor.
    </p>
    <h3>Dependent directories</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Dependent directories</b> can specify a freetext list of paths to directories on which this file
      set depends, e.g. directories of include files.
