In order to build 64-bit version of Kactus2, 64-bit compiled version of Qt libraries
is needed. 64-bit precompiled binaries are not available for VS2010 at Qt site (http://qt-project.org/downloads).
This file explains the procedure of building 64-bit Qt with VS2010.

-------------

In order to build 64-bit version of Qt 5.x, install the prerequisites in the following order:

* Visual Studio 2010 SP1

* Windows SDK 7.1

* Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Compiler Update for Windows SDK 7.1
